#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
->Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software systems.
 Importance of software engineering in the technology industry
 1. Quality assurance - Ensuring software products meet specified requirements and function correctly
 2. Cost efficiency - Reducing development and maintenance costs through proper planning and design
 3. Scalability - Creating systems that can grow with increasing user demands
 4. Time management - Enabling predictable development timelines and deliverables
 5. Risk mitigation - Identifying and addressing potential issues early in development


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The NATO Software Engineering Conferences (1968-1969)
These conferences marked the first formal recognition of the "software crisis" and coined the term "software engineering." As computer hardware capabilities expanded rapidly, software development lagged behind, with projects routinely exceeding budgets, missing deadlines, and delivering unreliable systems. These conferences established software engineering as a discipline that required structured approaches similar to traditional engineering fields.
2. The Emergence of Structured Programming (1970s)
Led by computer scientists like Edsger Dijkstra and his influential paper "Go To Statement Considered Harmful" (1968), structured programming revolutionized software development by introducing disciplined approaches to program design. This milestone brought forth concepts like modularity, information hiding, and control structures (if-then-else, while loops, etc.), moving away from spaghetti code and arbitrary goto statements. Languages like Pascal embodied these principles and laid groundwork for modern programming paradigms.
3. The Agile Manifesto (2001)
This represented a paradigm shift from heavyweight, documentation-driven approaches to software development. Seventeen software practitioners met in Snowbird, Utah and created the Agile Manifesto, which prioritized individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. This milestone fundamentally transformed how teams organize, develop software, and interact with stakeholders. Methodologies like Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), and Kanban that grew from this movement now dominate the industry landscape and have influenced project management beyond software.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 1. Requirements Analysis: Gathering and documenting what the software needs to do. This involves stakeholder interviews, market research, and creating detailed specifications that define system functionality, constraints, and goals.
 2. Planning: Establishing project timelines, resource allocation, cost estimates, and risk management strategies. Teams determine the technical approach and create a project roadmap.
 3. Design: Creating the software architecture and detailed design specifications. This includes database schemas, system interfaces, algorithms, UI/UX designs, and component interactions.
 4. Implementation/Coding: Writing the actual code based on the design documents. Developers follow coding standards and use appropriate programming languages and frameworks.
 5. Testing: Verifying that the software works correctly through various testing methods:

Unit testing (individual components)
Integration testing (component interactions)
System testing (complete application)
User acceptance testing (client validation)


 6. Deployment: Releasing the software to the production environment. This includes installation, configuration, data migration, and user training.
 7. Maintenance and Support: Addressing issues, implementing enhancements, and ensuring ongoing functionality after deployment. This involves bug fixes, performance tuning, and adapting to changing requirements.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
a). Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall follows a sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Progress flows in one direction like a waterfall, with distinct phases of requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance.
b). Agile Methodology
Agile delivers software in short iterations (typically 2-4 weeks), focusing on continuous improvement and customer feedback. It values working software over comprehensive documentation and adapts to changing requirements.
Apropriate scenarios for waterfall methodology:
.Projects with clear, unchanging requirements
.Regulated industries requiring extensive documentation (medical devices, aerospace)
.Large infrastructure projects with fixed scope
.Systems with critical safety requirements
.When working with clients who prefer predictable timelines and budgets
.Legacy system migrations with well-defined specifications

Apropriate scenarios for Agile methodologies:
.Projects with evolving or unclear requirements
.Innovative products entering new markets
.Startups needing to pivot based on market feedback
.Web and mobile application development
.When time-to-market is critical
.Product development requiring frequent user feedback
.Teams with experienced, self-organizing members

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
 - collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
 - analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
 - develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
 . Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
 . An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
 . IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
 . An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
 
 Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.

Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing are all important types of software testing that help ensure software quality. 
 a). Unit testing 
Ensures that individual units of code are correct
A type of white box testing that tests written code
 b). Integration testing 
Verifies that components interact properly
A type of black-box testing that tests interactions between modules
Combines units into a program to test how they run together
System testing Validates the entire system and Ensures that the system meets its specifications. 
 c). Acceptance testing 
Ensures that the software meets user expectations and business requirements
The final step in the testing process
Performed before the software is deployed to production
 d). Software quality assurance 
Monitors software engineering processes to ensure compliance with standards
Includes reviews and audits to verify that the software meets quality criteria

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs.
 Importance of prompt engineering
   a). Defining the Right Tasks and Objectives:
 -Clear Goals:
Before interacting with any AI model, you must clearly define the problem you're trying to solve or the goal you want to achieve. This helps determine the right model and sets expectations for the AI's performance. 
 -Task Specificity:
AI models are often specialized, and it's important to frame your request in a way that aligns with the model's capabilities. For example, if you are using a language model, you need to provide clear and specific instructions about the type of text you need it to generate or analyze. 
 b). Input Data and Model Training:
 -Data Quality Matters:
AI models learn from data. The more relevant and reliable your input data, the better the model can perform. Make sure your data is properly formatted, cleaned, and representative of the real world.
 -Bias Awareness:
Be mindful of potential biases within your data, as these biases can influence the model's outputs. Understand and address these biases to ensure fairness and accuracy.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 -Draw a picture of a person
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
